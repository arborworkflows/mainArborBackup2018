Originally described under genus <i>Trachya</i>, this species has as known junior synonyms <i>Tuberella aaptos</i> sensu Wilson (1902) and <i>Prostylissa spongia</i> de Laubenfels, 1953 (see also R&#252;tzler et al., 2014). There is a great deal of confusion regarding how many species there are in the Greater Caribbean shallow waters, with names such as <i>Aaptos duchassaingi</i> (Topsent, 1889), <i>A. bergmani</i> de Laubenfels, 1953  and <i>A. lithophaga</i> (Wiedenmayer, 1977) still to be clarified, plus species recently described from NE Brazil by Moraes (2011), <i>Aaptos glutinans</i>, and by Carvalho, da Silva &#38; Pinheiro (2013), <i>A. hajdui</i> and <i>A. potiguarensis</i>. We found three distinct species of <i>Aaptos</i> growing together in the Florida Bay side of Key Largo, all pictured here, one black, with large spicules (<i>A. pernucleata</i>), one dark brown and tuberculate, with smaller spicules (<i>Aaptos</i> sp.2), and the third light brown and smooth with slightly thicker spicules (<i>Aaptos</i> sp.3). Following R&#252;tzler et al. (2014), we decided to call the black morphotype <i>A. pernucleata</i>. On the other hand, our material from the Bahamas concurs with <i>Epipolasis lithophaga</i> Wiedenmayer, 1977, although our spicules are predominantly true hastate styles instead of the anysostrongyloxea typical of <i>Aaptos</i> and as described by Wiedenmayer (1977). However, its skeletal arrangement coincides with <i>Aaptos</i>. Pending further work and analysis of types, we hypothesize that black <i>A. lithophaga</i> is a junior synonym of <i>A. pernucleata</i> regardless of its smaller spicule size, as spicules tend to be smaller in the Bahamas in general and co-occurring morphotypes should be compared instead of relying on absolute size.Rounded masses to thick, sprawling encrustations, up to 10-50 cm in diameter and 2-20 cm thick. Color of the upper exterior black, base and interior cream. Surface generally even, smooth, often covered with sediment, but can be tuberculated, in portions or throughout the body; oscules round, slightly elevated or even, with the black rim contrasting with the surrounding sediment-covered surface, 2-5 mm in diameter. In some specimens, there are narrow meandering crevices, a few mm long and <1 mm in diameter. Consistency tough, rather leathery. Skeleton as ascending, diverging and reconnecting tracts, 4-15 spicule thick, which deep in the choanosome are more sparsely separated but become more crammed towards the surface, where they open up in about 2-3 layers of successively smaller spicules , the topmost one being a palisade of densely packed bouquets of the smaller spicule category. As spicule size varies with geographical location, specimens of areas with larger and thicker spicule sizes show much denser and thicker tracts. When visible, tissue in between ascending tracts with many small spicules strewn in confusion and often with darkly pigmented granular cells.  Spicules in Bahamian specimens are slightly curved styles with smoth to slightly rugose heads and sharp to strongly mucronated tips; a few of the smaller spicules have a narrower head, conforming to anysostrongyloxea. Spicules in other areas are slightly curved anysostrongyloxeas (=fusiform styles) with the thickest portion in the apical half, resulting in very narrow heads and thicker tips, usually slightly telescopic; some heads may be slightly bulging, especially in smaller sizes.

It was originally placed under genus <i>Acanthella</i>. It was also known as <i>Oxeostylon</i> (or <i>Teichaxinella</i>) <i>burtoni</i> de Laubenfels, 1934.  Initially, we were lumping together all orange to orange-yellow bushy, tubular, subtubular and ramose individuals having two categories of styles and oxea under <i>A. corrugata</i>. Closer inspection led us to separate the material by the overall shape in <i>A. corrugata</i> proper, <i>A. ?digitiformis</i> Lehnert &#38; van Soest, 1996, <i>A. ?pomponiae</i> Alvarez, van Soest &#38; R&#252;tzler, 1998, and <i>Axinella</i> sp.-&quot;orange corrugated tubes&quot;. (A fifth species with the same spicule complement of the others, <i>Axinella</i> sp.-&quot;orange-yellow velvety tubes&quot;, had a shape so different that it was clearly a different species.) In general, <i>A. corrugata</i> has larger styles I and oxea than the othes species, when co-existing specimens are compared. The most similar in shape to <i>A. corrugata</i> is <i>A. ?digitiformis</i>; because of the consistently subtubular habit of the latter we decided to keep it as a separate species until further studies; unfortunately, we did not save material of the latter species for more detailed study of spicules and skeleton.<br /><br />Molecular studies have found that <i>A. corrugata</i> and some other species of the genus <i>Axinella</i> are not closely related to the type species of the genus <i>Axinella</i>, <i>A. polypoides</i> (Schmidt, 1862), which led to the erection of the phylocode genus <i>Cymbaxinella</i> (family Himerhabdiidae, order Agelasida) to contain them (Gazave et al., 2010; Morrow et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2013). We prefer to follow the Linnean nomenclatorial system over the phylocode, and thus have decided to maintain the name <i>Axinella</i> for this species while the appropriate genus name (available or new) is found for the clade where this and other species belong.<br /><br /><i>Teichaxinella morchella</i> Wiedenmayer, 1977, originally described from the Bahamas, was synonymized to <i>A. corrugata</i> by Alvarez et al. (1998). Upon closer and repeated comparisons of material, we believe the former is a different species, also pictured here as <i>Axinella morchella</i>. <i>Axinella morchella</i> has a softer and smoother (lustrous) skin, stretched among ridges. In addition, it has only styles as spicules, in contrast to the additional oxea in <i>A. corrugata</i>. In life, they are unmistakably different in shape, color and texture.<br /><br /><i>Axinella corrugata</i> has been the subject of numerous studies in chemistry of natural products (e.g., Wilson et al., 1999) and their biotechnological production (e.g., Duckworth et al., 2003). It is interesting to note that the above-mentioned confusion between <i>A. corrugata</i> and <i>A. morchella</i> may have permeated these studies and others in molecular systematics (e.g. Holmes &#38; Blanch, 2007; Gazave et al., 2010; Morrow et al., 2012; Redmond et al., 2013). In several cases the material has come from the Bahamas and most probably it could have been actually <i>A. morchella</i> instead of <i>A. corrugata</i>, the former being much more abundant. Indeed, the most recent 18S Ribosomal DNA tree (Redmond et al., 2013, fig. 12) shows two distinct clades of &quot;<i>Cymbaxinella</i>&quot; <i>corrugata</i> that may correspond to these two species. One clade contains the samples from Bocas del Toro, Panama, and the other contains a sample from the Bahamas and a sample from the Florida Keys (and another of unknown origin; see Redmond et al., 2013, file 019 of the supplemental material). As it appears that <i>A. morchella</i> does not occur in Bocas del Toro and the Southern Caribbean (pers. obs. S.Z.), the samples from this locality are probably <i>A. corrugata</i>; the material from the other clade could thus belong to <i>A. morchella</i>.  The vouchers need to be reexamined to determine their real identity. At any rate, the results of Redmond et al. (2013) point that the real <i>A. corrugata</i> does not belong to the genus <i>Axinella</i> proper.Low bushes, sometimes flattened, up to about 5 m high and wide, with the surface made of flattened or sometimes rounded lamellae or protrusions, often vertically oriented as folds that run vertically for part or the entire sponge. Oscules can be seen in some specimens as small holes (up to about 2 mm) surrounded by a thin membrane. Surface usually velvety, but can be hispid in the ridges of folds. Color orange-yellow. Consistency stiffly compressible. Skeleton as sinuous and confused spicule tracts arising from the center of the bush and ascending and diverging radially towards all surfaces; tracts with 3 to 6 spicules, 40-100 &#181;m  thick, embedded in variable amounts of sponging, separated between 100 and 150 &#181;m; scarcely interconnected mostly by single spicules, thus not seen as much as a reticulation. Ascending tracts are more condensed below the surface. The outer surface is hispidated by the terminal spicules of the ascending tracts. Spicules in two types (sizes from measurements from Bahamian and Colombian material, the latter given by Zea, 1987): (1) curved styles, with some heads slightly engrossed terminally or subterminally, and acute points, in two size categories, styles I, 250-442 &#181;m long by 2.3-19&#181;m wide, the most abundant; and styles II, long and slender, but scarcer, 523-974 &#181;m long and 2.4-19 &#181;m wide. (2) Slightly curved oxea with blunt to acute ends, mostly with symmetric ends, 304-807 &#181;m long and 2.4-21.4 &#181;m wide."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00017/00533.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00050/01466.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01850.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01851.JPG","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01852.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01853.jpg","text":"Axinella_corrugata_ott812988"}],"node name":"Axinella corrugata","node weight":0,"nodeid":85}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0,"nodeid":83}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"orange "},{"Location":"deep reef  rocky shore/shallow reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"encrusting  lobate  massive  spherical "},{"Description":"Orange, football shaped to crevice filling with lobate outgrowths; round oscules with a collar.

It tends to overgrow other organisms, including dead portions of corals, with which it may be aggressively interacting. Originally placed under genus <i>Ulosa</i> (see R&#252;tzler, 1981). The larger category of strongyles observed in the Bahamas (only one specimen examined in detail) is striking, although their typical wide dark axial canal makes them unmistakably proper.Thin encrustations, about 1-3 mm thick, irregularly extended over the substratum for up to 50 cm or more, often overgrowing other sponges, sometimes evenly encrusting, but more often riddled with many erect processes and tangled cylindrical branchelets with rounded ends, which when fused make the sponge turf-like or massive. Often specimens are irregular in outline or have internal empty patches. Surface of the tissue is smooth, looking porous. Color dark olive green, internally and externally, sometimes grayish, produced by endosymbiotic round cyanobacteria (<i>Aphanocapsa raspaigella</i>-like, D&#237;az et al., 2007) which occupy up to 50 % of the tissue (R&#252;tzler, 1981). Consistency soft, easily torn, the branchelets collapse  out of the water. Skeleton is a vague and irregular reticulation of spongin fibers, 20-50 &#181;m wide, clean or cored by one to few spicules forming 10-40 &#181;m-wide tracts. There is abundant foreign debris (sand and spicules) throughout the body and inside fibers, sometimes forming a 100-150 &#181;m thick cortex, but very variable within and among specimens.

Its large size makes it a conspicuous sponge, and its shape and hard texture usually unmistakable. However, from molecular and morphological studies being carried out by Paco C&#225;rdenas (Uppsala University, Sweden), it appears that it may be a complex of species. Adding to the problem, local populations seem to vary slighlty in overall morphology and juveniles may not yet take the usual inverted cone shape of the larger specimens.  One sample from the Bahamas and another from San Andr&#233;s Island (SW Caribbean, Colombia) were sequenced and analyzed by P. C&#225;rdenas and confirmed to correspond to <i>G.  neptuni</i>. Nevertheless, some variation in spiculation noted among Bahamian samples from the may need further study to confirm conspecificity. Larger spicules in samples from the continental coast of Colombia are probably due to higher silica contents in the water. Also placed in the genus or subgenus <i>Sidonops</i>, which was later synonymized to <i>Geodia</i> (C&#225;rdenas et al., 2010), and transiently considered a junior synonym of <i>G. vosmaeri</i> (Sollas, 1886) (see Silva, 2002; C&#225;rdenas et al., 2010; 2011).Large and thick, inverted cones, with deep furrows in the inner surface and shallower furrows and scattered holes, rounded or elongated, in the outer surface; the wall of the cones may be relatively thin or relatively thick, in the latter with a rounded concave oscular plate. Individuals may reach 1 m in diameter and height. Oscules are located inside the furrows, more grouped towards the center and sparse in the outer portions. Smaller individuals or tend to be massive, with a central depression (or several smaller ones) with a concave oscular plate. Surface in between holes is usually smooth and rather shiny, although it can be fouled. Color cinnamon-tan to brown, with orange tinges; interior cream. Consistency very hard and tough, difficult to cut or tear. The peripheral skeleton from exterior to interior is conformed first by a cortex of densely packed sterraster microscleres, up to 875 &#181;m in thickness, traversed horizontally and vertically by canals, the latter ones being up to 50 &#181;m in diameter. The pinacoderm is stretched above the cortex, being heavily embedded by the smaller category of aster microscleres but traversed by a few of the smaller category of anystrongyloxea-oxea II megascleres. Below the sterraster cortex there follows a 2 mm or more fibrous subcortex with a few scattered sterrasters. Further below, there is a 200 &#181;m-thick subcortical layer of sterrasters aligned with the cladomes of triaene megascleres, whose rhabds are pointed downwards. These triaenes occur usually in bundles, which together with oxea I, conform ascending diverging and converging spicule tracts, 75-250 &#181;m thick. In between tracts, there are abundant small oxea and anysostrongyloxea II and dispersed sterrasters and oxyasters, the latter embedded in the pinacoderm lining canals.  Further inwards, the tracts are looser, with many spicules in confusion. Megasclere spicules in three types: (1) Oxea I, with several styloid and strongyloid derivations, some true styles, slightly curved, usually hastate, stout, the smaller ones thin and fusiform, 600-2025 &#181;m long and 5-30 &#181;m wide, being longer in material from the continental coast of Colombia (up to 2025 &#181;m vs. 1500 &#181;m in the Bahamas). (2) Anysostrongyloxea II (several fully oxea), slightly curved, with one end narrower and blunt and the other acute, 160-460 &#181;m long and 2-6.3 &#181;m wide. (3) Plagiotriaenes, with generally short and sometimes blunt-ended clades, 25-180 &#181;m long and 10-40 &#181;m wide at the base; rhabds also stout, acute or blunt at the ends, 640-1525 &#181;m long and 15-65 &#181;m wide at the base. Rhabds with a single terminal, forward directed clad were observed (promonaenes), 750-2550 &#181;m long by 6.3-15 &#181;m wide. Microscleres in two basic types: (1) Sterrasters, round, variable in diameter depending on the specimen and the locality (Bahamas, 40-53 &#181;m and 58-63 &#181;m; Islas del Rosario, Colombia, 78-83 &#181;m), with spined rosettes up to about 5-7 &#181;m in diameter; developmental stages are smaller balls surrounded by thin needles to larger ones surrounded by conical stout conical spines from which the rosettes would develop. (2) Asters in two or three categories (difficult to discern under light microscopy), with spined rays; large oxyasters with 6-8 slender rays,  12.5-15 &#181;m in total diameter in the Bahamas and 17.5-32.5 &#181;m  in Colombia, some being stout, with rays up to 3.8 &#181;m thick at the base; smaller strongyl- or oxyasters, 5-8.5 &#181;m in total diameter."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00114/00063.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00114/00072.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00080/00117.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00019/00680.JPG","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00074/01724.jpg","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00075/01739.jpg","text":"Geodia_neptuni_ott157941"}],"node name":"Geodia neptuni","node weight":0,"nodeid":119}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0,"nodeid":117}},{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"cream  orange-yellow  yellow "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"soft  tough "},{"Morphology":"spherical "},{"Description":"Previously placed under genus <i>Cinachyra</i>.

(2) Oxea and styles II, slightly curved, the oxea fusiform, the styles hastate, 210-380 &#181;m long and 2.3-17 &#181;m wide. (3) Triaenes in three types: Plagiotriaenes, the most common, slender to stout, with generally short and acute clades, 17-100 &#181;m long and 7.5-21 &#181;m wide at the base; rhabds also stout, acute at the ends, 410-1075 &#181;m long and 8.8-30 &#181;m wide at the base. Anatrianes, thin and slender, with relatively small clades, 2.5-10.5 &#181;m long and up to 5 &#181;m wide at the base; rhabds thin and long, acute, 350-610 &#181;m long and 2-7 &#181;m wide. Rare mesoprotriaenes, with short (up to 22) clads and long (860 x 6 &#181;m) rhabds. Microscleres in two basic types: (1) Sterrasters, round, relatively large, 62.5-80 &#181;m in diameter, with small spined rosettes (up to about 4 &#181;m in diameter), which have warts over the spines (rather difficult to observe in light microscopy); developmental stages of sterrasters are smaller balls surrounded by thin needles. (2) Asters in three categories (difficult to discern under light microscopy), with spined rays; large oxyasters, one class with up to 9 slender rays, and the other with stouter and more numerous (up to 20) rays, both reaching up to 32.5-35 &#181;m in total diameter; smaller strongyl- or oxyasters, 6.3-7.5 &#181;m in total diameter."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00115/01912.jpg","text":"Geodia_papyracea_ott71334"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini//Spicule Images//Geodia papyracea PSB 043 spicules.jpg","text":"Geodia_papyracea_ott71334"}],"node name":"Geodia papyracea","node weight":0,"nodeid":124}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"brown "},{"Location":"mangrove/coastal lagoon "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"massive  spherical "},{"Description":"Originally described under genus <i>Jaspis</i>.

It was originally described under genus <i>Spongia</i>, and later under <i>Adocia</i>, <i>Pellina</i> and <i>Xestospongia</i> (see van Soest, 1984; Zea, 1987). The size of the spicules is intermediary between typical <i>Neopetrosia</i> (up to 200 &#181;m long) and <i>Xestospongia</i> (usually larger than 200 &#181;m and reaching more than 400 &#181;m). In the western and northern Caribbean it may be confused with <i>N. rosariensis</i> (Zea &#38; R&#252;tzler, 1983), also pictured here, which take a shape of low tube-mounds brown-black in color, often with greenish shades, and may also have branchelets; a detailed comparison of spicules and skeleton of co-existing specimens needs to be made. In the field <i>N. carbonaria</i> could also be confused with coexisting black to dark green specimens of <i>Halichondria melanodocia</i> de Laubenfels, 1936, also pictured  here, but can be readily distinguished by the much softer consistency and by the much longer and varied in size oxea spicules of the latter.Thickly encrusting to massive, often elongated, generally as thick as wide, up to about 15-30 cm long, 10 cm wide and thick, with dispersed volcano-like oscular elevations, 0.5 to 2-3 cm high; oscules up to 1 cm in diameter, but usually smaller. Masses often occur in groups, sometimes connected by lower bridges, sometimes growing lateral repent branches or erect branchelets. On rubble or sand, they may be half buried, showing the oscules as papillae. Surface even and smooth or microrugose to tuberculated, clean or fouled or covered with sand. Color black to very dark green, internally and externally, maintaining its color preserved and when dry. Consistency firm, crumbly especially in oscules and elevations. Skeleton (from Zea, 1987, as <i>Pellina carbonaria</i>) as thick spicule tracts, 4-15 spicules in cross section and 60-160 &#181;m thick, forming a reticulation of rounded to rectangular to polygonal, 130-650 &#181;m wide meshes, often with loose spicules in confusion. Near the surface, it becomes as ascending and interconnecting tracts, engrossed in steps as growth layers. The ectosome is an isodictyal regular reticulation of single spicules joined by spongin at their nodes, overlying the thicker subsuperficial reticulation. Spicules are robust hastate oxeas, slightly curved, sometimes double bent, and thinner developmental stages, 162-299 &#181;m long and 1.4-21-4 &#181;m wide; sizes in southern Caribbean sites are larger than in northern ones. Where spicules were larger, there was a complement of toxiform raphide microscleres with a central swelling, 22-45 x 0.1-1.2 &#181;m."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02053.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02054.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02055.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02056.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02057.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02058.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_carbonaria_ott2835873"}],"node name":"Neopetrosia carbonaria","node weight":0,"nodeid":132}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0,"nodeid":130}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"cinnamon-tan  cream  gray  green  orange  pink-lilac  yellow "},{"Location":"deep reef  rocky shore/shallow reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"fan  spherical  tube  vase "},{"Description":"Groups of cylindrical tubes, sometimes wider at the top, forming vases, grayish, pinkish, yellowish, with smooth conules.

It was originally described under genus <i>Haliclona</i> and later placed under <i>Pachypellina</i> (see van Soest, 1984; Zea, 1987). <i>Haliclona dura</i> Sandes, Bispo &#38; Pinheiro, 2014, recently described from tropical Brazil should be compared in detail, as the overall shape matches some of our studied specimens; it has oxeas with irregular endings, 105-193 x 2.5-9 &#181;m.

Continental Colombian specimens are repent, cylindrical hollow branches, up to about 1-2 cm in diameter, buried among corals, yellowish brown, with isolated or grouped oscules, 1-2 mm in diameter, often contorted, with a slightly elevated rim wall. Panamanian specimens are grayish brown and range in shape from lobed encrustations to erect anastomosed branches, which are irregular, having up to 1 cm thin portions followed by masses 2-5 cm thick and then by 2-5 mm wide branchelets. All these specimens are characterized by having a cavernous interior that is visible at the surface where roofs are thin or below groups of oscular openings. The consistency is thus firm but crumbly. The skeleton is a uni to paucispicular isotropic reticulation, forming triangular to polygonal meshes 100-150 &#181;m in diameter, often confused by crisscrossing spicules, and here and there with clearly ascending tracts, 2-5 spicules thick. Colombian (see Zea, 1987) and Panamanian specimens have horizontally-placed tracts, 4-6 spicule thick, ca. 40 &#181;m in diameter, which appear as growth lines, placed at 100-600 &#181;m intervals. At the surface there is a unispicular reticulation with triangular meshes, overlying the more confused interior; in some portions it becomes a sheet of confused spicules.

In the southern Caribbean it occurs as long, reddish brown, usually smooth tubes, single or in groups, sometimes reaching 1 m in height and 5-10 cm in diameter, with walls up to about 1-2 cm thick; the surface may be riddled with zoanthids or hydroids; oscules small, up to about 1 mm in diameter, aligned in concentric lines in the inner surface of the tubes. Consistency stony hard, difficult to cut and break, although smaller specimens may have crumbly areas over subdermal cavities. The skeleton is an irregular, isotropic, uni- to paucispicular (up to 5-8 spicules) reticulation, forming triangular to irregular, closed meshes, up to 100 &#181;m wide; here and there, the skeleton surround rounded, 300-650 &#181;m  wide canals. Near the surface, the skeleton becomes more open and more anisotropic, with clear ascending and interconnecting tracts, that end up at the surface supporting a unispicular reticulation of triangular meshes. In cross sections of tubes the radial-ascending growth lines can be seen with the naked eye. Spicules are hastate oxea to strongyloxea, slightly curved, with pointed, rounded, or mammiform endings, sometimes slightly asymmetric as to appear slightly styloid.

Originaly described under genus <i>Thalysias</i>, it was also located under genus <i>Xestospongia</i> (see van Soest, 1984). <i>Densa araminta</i> de Laubenfels, 1934 is a junior synonym (see Zea, 1987, under <i>Xestospongia proxima</i>). The regional variability in predominant size and shape is intriguing, as it is the especially large local variability at Bocas del Toro, Panama. Whether there are more than one species in this assemblage of forms and colors, remains to be determined with other tools. The density of the tissue, the sticky texture when cut and the skeleton of oxeas in fasciculated tracts is the underlying characteristic of all specimens analyzed. In some cases, there are specimens that can be confused with <i>Calyx podatypa</i> (de Laubenfels, 1934), also pictured here, but the latter has a more cavernous interior (and hence a more crumbly consistency), more uniformly-sized spicules, a more isotropic skeletal reticulation, and lacks the sticky texture when handled. Another co-existing species with which it can be confused is <i>Neopetrosia</i> sp.-&quot;soft&quot;, also pictured here, but it is readily distinguished by its softer, crumblier, non-sticky texture, and its more uniformly sized oxea spicules arranged in ascending tracts interconnected by single spicules. Deep-water <i>Xestospongia</i> cf. <i>proxima</i> sensu van Soest &#38; Stentoft (1988) was recently described as new <i>Neopetrosia eurystomata</i> van Soest, Meestres &#38; Becking, 2014. Vase-shaped, deep-water <i>Neopetrosia ovata</i> van Soest, Meesters &#38; Becking, 2014 is also similar in skeleton and spicule size to <i>N. proxima</i>.Shape varies from 1-2 cm thick encrustations, 10-20 cm tall masses, even or lobed, to 2-5 cm thick branches, flattened or cylindrical, single, ramified or anastomosing, erect or repent. Bahamian specimens are usually encrusting; Colombian specimens from Santa Marta are usually massive; in Bocas del Toro, Panama, there are encrusting and branching. Size may reach 50 cm in lateral extension. Surface is usually even, rugose to the touch, with oscules scattered, up to about 5 mm in diameter, flush or on slightly raised, or on top of mounds, often with a lightly colored rim; massive specimens may have elongated crevices. Color also varies regionally, with Bahamian specimens being dark brown, those at Santa Marta pink to purple and at Bocas from yellowish to tannish to brownish; internal color always cream. Consistency is hard but not very brittle; the tissue is very dense, making it hard for a knife to cut through; very characteristically, there is a sticky feeling to the touch when cut. The choanosome is dense but riddled with small, <1 mm canals. The skeleton is an irregular reticulation of fasciculated multispicular tracts, some 50-750 &#181;m thick, surrounding rounded to vertically elongated meshes, 70-500 &#181;m in diameter. These fascicles are themselves made up of an isotropic to confused reticulation of single spicules or multispicular tracts, often with many free spicules strewn in confusion, in portions very dense and appearing dark under the microscope. At the ectosome, there is usually a &quot;cortex&quot; up to about 600 &#181;m thick, overlying rounded subsurface spaces, up to about 1 mm in diameter; thick, fascicular tracts roof these spaces ending at the surface in thick erect spicule brushes. Overall, the ectosome usually looks as a paratangential reticulation of thick spicule tracts, 20-170 &#181;m thick, forming rounded, 100-250 &#181;m meshes, with erect spicule brushes at the intersections. Spicules are hastate oxeas to strongyloxeas, slightly curved, in a relatively wide size range, with thinner developmental stages. At the Bahamas they are slender, usually with blunt, mammiform, to strongylote ends, sometimes asymmetric, 87-158 &#181;m long by 2.3-5-7 &#181;m wide. Spicules at the continental coast of Colombia and at Panama are more robust hastate oxea with short, acute endings, reaching larger and thicker sizes, 75-223 &#181;m long by 1.7-10.7 &#181;m wide."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00006/00324.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00006/00325.JPG","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00121/00709.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00034/01151.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02013.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00117/02014.jpg","text":"Neopetrosia_proxima_ott4939006"}],"node name":"Neopetrosia proxima","node weight":0,"nodeid":167}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0,"nodeid":158}},{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"black "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"tough "},{"Morphology":"encrusting "},{"Description":"Black, thickly encrusting; skeleton as a reticulation of spongin fibers with a few spicules embedded in the ascending fibers.

The species was originally described under the genus <i>Topsentia</i>. It was erroneously know by many Caribbean authors as <i>Myrmekioderma styx</i> (de Laubenfels, 1953), which is a junior synonym of <i>M. rea</i> (de Laubenfels, 1934), a different valid species (also depicted here). It is distinguished from <i>M. rea</i> by its large, stout oxea; the latter has thinner styles-styloids (with a few oxea), and examined specimens from Colombia and Panama have one or more sizes of raphides, usually in trichodragmata, lacking in <i>M. gyroderma</i>. Also, the grooves in <i>M. rea</i> tend to be circular, surrounding rounded elevated areas which become wart-like when the sponge is handled and fixed. Besides, although both species coexist in many localities, <i>M. gyroderma</i> lives on hard exposed substrata on the reef, while <i>M. rea</i> fills reef crevices or dwells buried in sand and rubble in lagoonal settings, although sometimes the latter may be massive and live exposed, as in Martinique and Bocas del Toro (Panama). We have not seen <i>M. gyroderma</i> in the southernmost Caribbean reefs such as those from the NW Gulf of Urab&#225; (Colombia) and Bocas del Toro. In the field, whenever they occur together, <i>Myrmekioderma gyroderma</i> can be confused with <i>Didiscus oxeata</i>, also pictured here. Both have an overall aspect of fouled surface pierced by with orange-yellow grooves, but these tend to be wider and less meandering in <i>D. oxeata</i>, which also has more cylindrical lobes with wide oscular areas on top; the presence of unique discorhab spicules next to stout oxea makesthe latter species distinct.Thick masses with conical or lobed oscular elevations, up to 30 cm or more wide and 5-10 cm high. Oscules single or in groups of 2-3, up to about 1 cm in diameter.

Skeleton as a coarse reticulation of ascending and interconnecting tracks of 2-5 spicules with many spicules strewn in confusion, forming meshes up to about 150-200 &#181;m wide; ascending tracts converge and diverge rather irregularly, becoming strongly confluent near the surface to form a cortex of thick spicule pillars, 125-500 &#181;m wide, separating subsuperficial spaces up to 1250 &#181;m wide. The pillars open up in a dense tangle of confused spicule bouquets that conforms a cortex, some 500 &#181;m thick, mostly made of the smaller spicule type (acanthoxea). The subsuperficial spaces are probably part of the groove’s labyrinth. At the top part of the cortex there are many foreign particles. Spicules in two types: (1) Oxeas I, slightly curved, often with telescopic, slightly asymmetric ends (one end sharp, the other blunt), somewhat slender in material from the Bahamas, much more robust in specimens from the continental coast of Colombia, 630-970 &#181;m long by 6-41 &#181;m wide; a few true styles are present, but appear as modifications of the oxea.

The former name was used erroneously by several Caribbean authors for <i>M. gyroderma</i> (Alcolado, 1984), also pictured here. <i>M. rea</i> may co-exists sympatrically with <i>M. gyroderma</i> in reefs, but it is distinguished from the latter partly for its growth form (usually cavity-filling and cryptic in <i>M. rea</i>, massive and exposed in <i>M. gyroderma</i>, although the former may be massive and live exposed in some areas such as Martinique and Bocas del Toro in Panama), the circular grooves (elongated and meandering in <i>M. gyroderma</i>), and in having thinner styles to anysostrongyles instead of oxeas as principal spicules. A third species, recently described from the tropical eastern Brazil, <i>Myrmekioderma intrastrongyla</i> Sandes &#38; Pinheiro, 2013, has strongyles like our material from the Bahamas; these species should be more closely compared in light of our findings. <i>Myrmekioderma rea</i> can also be confused with <i>Didiscus oxeata</i>, also pictured here.

When buried, only the oscular areas are barely seen, with the surface as a stretched membrane with fields of oscules over confluent exhalant canals; in lobes, oscules can be at the top, single or in groups, usually less than 1 cm in diameter, although sometimes they can be seen as long sinuous or meandering bands, ca. 5 mm wide, from which strands of tissue are stretched from side to side, the spaces conforming the oscules. Buried surfaces or free sides have thin (1-2 mm wide) circular grooves. These elevated areas in between grooves tend to be circular and are heavily fouled, and become wart-like when specimens contract upon handling and fixation. Color of the tissue orange-yellow. Consistency toughly compressible, but more easily damaged than the preceding species, especially in the buried portions. Skeleton structure (only analyzed in a Bahamian specimen) not very dense, as loosely packed ascending tracks of spicules (mostly of the spined type), more densely packed in the outer portions, where there is a cortex packed with foreign material. Foreign debris also tends to accumulate at the base. Grooves appear as subsuperficial round canals, some 200 &#181;m in diameter, followed below by areas of tissue free of skeleton. Spicules in three types: (1) Anysostrongyles (styloids) to styles. In the Bahamas these are anysostrongyles with one round or mammiform side, and the other narrower roundish, blunt or mammiform, 380-850 &#181;m long by 5.5-12.5 &#181;m wide. In Colombia (see Valderrama &#38; Zea, 2014), Martinique and Panama these are true styles with slightly blunt tips (with a few anysostrongyles), 735-1130 long by 7.7-19.4 &#181;m wide. (2) Strongyles to anysostrongyles to oxea, minutely spined. In the Bahamas these are slender, sinuous mostly anysostrongyloid, with a few oxeote, spined all over but less towards the center, 195-470 &#181;m long by 5.5-9.0 &#181;m wide.

It was originally described under genus <i>Axinella</i> and then placed under <i>Pseudaxinella</i> (see Alvarez et al., 1998), which was synonymized to <i>Dragmacidon</i> (see Alvarez &#38; Hooper, 2002). In their revision of western Atlantic Axinellidae, Alvarez et al. (1998) considered the existence of only one species of <i>Dragmacidon</i>, <i>D. reticulatum</i> (Ridley &#38; Dendy, 1886). However, we believe that there are two similarly-looking but clearly different species of <i>Dragmacidon</i> that often co-exist. From our examination of the type (BMNH 1887.5.2.11) and other material, this morphotype belongs to the actual <i>D. reticulatum</i>, while the other belongs to a species that falls under <i>D. lunaecharta</i> sensu Wiedenmayer (1977), also pictured here, which we are naming temporarily <i>D. &quot;lunaecharta&quot;</i> while a proper name is defined, because the original belongs to a distinct species from the E. Atlantic (Alvarez et al., 1998).<br /><br />In comparing what we are describing as <i>D. &quot;lunaecharta&quot;</i> and <i>D. reticulatum</i> the differences are clear. <i>D. reticulatum</i> has a more elaborated surface and is tougher, while <i>D. reticulatum</i> has a smoother surface, is softer and often grows erect. In coexisting specimens (e.g., Stirrups Cays, Bahamas, Santa Marta, Colombia), <i>D. &quot;lunaecharta&quot;</i> has smaller spicules, with the oxea slightly larger than the styles, while <i>D. reticulatum</i> has larger spicules and some of the styles as long as the oxea. The skeleton of <i>D. reticulatum</i> is made of thicker ascending spicule tracts, more widely separated and projecting on the surface as spines.  [Note of caution: in a previous edition of this guide, we switched the names for the two morphotypes of <i>Dragmacidon</i>:  <i>D. reticulatum</i> for the current <i>D. &quot;lunaecharta&quot;</i> and <i>D. explicatum</i> (Wiedenmayer, 1977) for the actual <i>D. reticulatum</i> (according to Alvarez et al., 1998, and to our examination of types, <i>D. explicatum is a junior synonym of <i>D. reticulatum</i>.)]Thick encrustations, with low or tall volcano-like elevations containing the oscules, which have a wide rim and are often partly or totally closed by a diaphragm Size up to 10-20 cm in diameter, 1-5 cm thick.

A third, ill known species, <i>L. imberbis</i> (Duch. &#38; Mich., 1864), may be a senior synonym of <i>L. floridana</i> (see WPD), although Lehnert &#38; van Soest (1998) described it as different and co-existing with <i>L. floridana</i> in Jamaica.Single or groups of volcano-shaped tubes, up to about 5 cm high and wide, hanging from cave walls or roofs, or arising from cracks or rubble in more exposed places. Oscules are usually about 0.5-1 cm in diameter, with an elevated collar which thins upward. The atrial cavity is wide and deep. Sometimes the walls of the tubes open, forming irregularly outlined vases-fans. Color light pink or lilac, or light whitish blue. Consistency stiff, like fiberglass; large triactine calcareous spicules stab fingers when handled. Outer (cortical) skeleton conformed by a layer of gigantic triactine spicules tangentially placed at the surface, covered by a layer of smaller tri- and tetractines. Below this cortical layer, the skeleton is a confused mass of spicules. Internal cavities and channels also appear paved by the tangential layer of smaller spicules, in some places with sagittal tri-and tretractines, in addition to the normal ones. We could not see in our tissue sections if the canals were spiked by the apical actines of the tetractines. Spicules are calcareous tri- and tetractines, equiradiate and equiangular. There are two categories of triactines. The smaller (triactines-I), have conical actines, slightly sinuous in outline, sometimes with the basal half cylindrical, and ending in hastate points, 105-260 &#181;m long by 15-30 &#181;m wide (at the base). There are a few smaller triactines, 35-55 x 7.5-10 &#181;m. The larger category of triactines (II) has a wide variety of sizes, from large to gigantic, with conical actines (the first half sometimes cylindrical), 500-3050 &#181;m long by 60-440 &#181;m wide (at the base). Tetractines in the specimens from the Bahamas occur only in the smaller class (I) and have the same overall morphology but are far less numerous and slightly smaller than the triactines-I, the actines measuring 120-190 x 15-21 &#181;m. Basal actine of tetractines I is usually thin (5.5-7.5 &#181;m) and small (up to about 25 &#181;m), pointed, curved or sinuous. There are also smaller tetractines I, with actines 42.5 x 8 &#181;m. Examined specimens from Gulf of Urab&#225; (Colombia), contained a few gigantic Tetractines II, 645-1316 x 96.8-219 &#181;m (Valderrama, 2001; see also Valderrama et al., 2009). Additionally, in some parts of the sponge (which may not be included in the sample processed for spicule analysis but are visible in thick sections of tissue), there are sagittal (one actine long, the other two smaller and symmetrical) tri- and tetractines, with the long actine 125-180 &#181;m by 12-18 &#181;m, and the smaller actines bent in a soaring bird wing fashion, about 90-100 &#181;m long (same maximal width of the long actine). Their apical actine (when tetractine) is also short."}],"images":[{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01200.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01201.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01202.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00039/01203.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00067/01826.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"},{"image":"http://spongeguide.org/mini/00067/01827.JPG","text":"Leucetta_floridana_ott464598"}],"node name":"Leucetta floridana","node weight":0,"nodeid":227}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"Clathrinida_ott606953","node weight":0,"nodeid":225}}],"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"node name":"","node weight":0,"nodeid":1}},{"children":[{"children":[{"edge_data":{"weight":1},"node_data":{"attributes":[{"Color":"black  brown  green "},{"Location":"deep reef "},{"Consistency":"soft "},{"Morphology":"encrusting  massive "},{"Description":"Dark brown to dark and light green to gray soft cushions with or without the characteristic pungent minty smell.

Specimens without spicules (also varying in color and smell) are included here as a separate species (<i>Plakortis</i> sp.-&quot;no spicules&quot;) pending further work with other tools. Indeed, some of our specimens of <i>P. angulospiculatus</i> appeared to have relatively few spicules. It may be that they all belong to one or several species (perhaps distinguished by predominant color) in which spicule contents vary ecologycally, from many to none. On the other hand, we have not yet carried out detailed analyses of spicule types (including searching for triods, microrhabds and spheres), to be able to distinguish among old and the many recently described Caribbean species with diods smaller than about 130 &#181;m, which are <i>Plakortis angulospiculatus</i>, <i>P. zygompha</i> (de Laubenfels, 1934), <i>P. insularis</i> Moraes &#38; Muricy, 2003, <i>P. microrhabdifera</i> Moraes &#38; Muricy, 2003, <i>P. myrae</i> Ereskovsky et al., 2013, <i>P. edwardsi</i> Ereskovsky et al., 2013, <i>P. dariae</i> Ereskovsky et al., 2013. <i>P. petrupaulensis</i> Domingos et al., 2013, <i>P. spinalis</i> Domingos et al., 2013, and </i>P. potiguarensis</i> Domingos et al., 2013.
